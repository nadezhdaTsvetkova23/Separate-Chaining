# ADS Set Implementation in C++

## Overview
This project is developed for the Algorithms and Data Structures course. It includes an implementation of a hash set using separate chaining technique in C++. The implementation is tailored to handle collisions and maintain efficient data access and manipulation.

## Features
- Implementation using templates in C++.
- Separate chaining to handle hash collisions.
- Methods for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
- Includes iterator support for traversing the set.

## Getting Started
To use this hash set implementation in your project, simply include the `ADS_set.h` header file in your C++ source file.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later due to the usage of certain C++ features like `std::optional`.
